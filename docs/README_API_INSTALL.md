## Installing WeVoteServer: Native development

Please note: We do not support direct development on Windows.
If you are using a Windows machine, we recommend:

A. Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

B. Set up your Windows machine as dual-boot with Linux

C. Setting up an [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and installing within that. 

In our experience, a Windows machine should have 8 GB RAM (minimum),
and you should allocate 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM to the virtual machine.

## Installing WeVoteServer: Vagrant and Ansible

You can build WeVoteServer as a Vagrant box using our
[Ansible-Vagrant project](https://github.com/wevote/ansible-django-stack).
Note that Ansible is straightforward to install on Mac and Linux hosts, but
Windows isn't supported by Ansible. You may try to
[install via Cygwin](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/running-ansible-within-windows),
or for Windows 10 or later,
[install via the Windows 10 subsystem](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/using-ansible-through-windows-10s-subsystem-linux),
at which point you should be able to proceed with the Ansible-Vagrant
instructions.

Alternatively, you can try the prebuilt Vagrant box, which lets you avoid Ansible setup entirely. [Using the prebuilt Vagrant box](README_API_INSTALL_VAGRANT_PREBUILT.md)
