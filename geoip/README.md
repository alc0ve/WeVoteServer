#### Description

We source control a version of the free GeoLite2-City.mmdb IP address
database.  The Master server uses the paid version that is more accurate.
Talk to Dale if you need to test with that higher accuracy.

If the version of GeoLite2-City.mmdb in source control gets outdated
feel free to download a new one from  https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/
and then overwrite and checkin the new db.
